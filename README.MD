Hello together, here I post my work on the advent of code. :D

It takes 143 complete iterations to get to a doubled value :)

It took a while to understand, what the hash sum is supposed to be. You are not supposed to count every letter just once (maximizing the hash sum at 26^2 but instead only count every ID once for having two and once for having three letters occuring. D'oh.

Solved it completly unoptimised. Hacked together a solution :/ It takes len(lines)^2 + len(lines) * id.x_length * id.y_lenght as it is not optimised. There is probably a solution using only a single loop, but i can't wrap my head around it using only lists, dicts, booleans, strings and integers. :(

Sad panda is sad. No solution today. I can't quite grasp the problem it seems.

### 5th Dec ###
Reading the assignment would help a lot in improving time to produce a solution. -.-

Took me forever to solve the first problem. Pretty sure I wasn't deciding whether a coordinate was infinite or not. Yet with the help of reddit, I got it working. And afterwards, getting Part II was like adding 7 lines of code and took like 2 minutes. I'm pretty happy about that :)
